/*

The adapter pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect.
Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

!!!Class Adapter is not possible in Java because you need multiple inheritance!!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

(Facade uses composition to realize this)
