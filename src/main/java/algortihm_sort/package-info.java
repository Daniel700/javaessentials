- Selection Sort:
-----------------
It is also a sorting algorithm in which first step is to find the smallest element in the array.
This smallest element is swapped with the first element.
After this, search for the smallest element in the subarray formed by excluding the first element
and compare it with the first element of the subarray. Repeat it till the array gets sorted.

Worst Case Performance:         О(n^2)
Average Case Performance:       О(n^2)
Best Case Performance:          O(n^2)
Worst Case Space Complexity:    О(n) total, O(1) auxiliary


- Insertion Sort:
-----------------
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm in which sorting is done by picking one array element
at a time and inserting it into already sorted subarray.

Worst Case Performance:         О(n^2) comparisons, swaps
Average Case Performance:       О(n^2) comparisons, swaps
Best Case Performance:          O(n) comparisons, O(1) swaps
Worst Case Space Complexity:    О(n) total, O(1) auxiliary


- Bubble Sort:
--------------
It is a sorting algorithm in which two adjacent elements of an array are checked and swapped
if they are in wrong order and this process is repeated until we get a sorted array.

Worst Case Performance:         О(n^2)
Average Case Performance:       О(n^2)
Best Case Performance:          O(n)
Worst Case Space Complexity:    О(1) auxiliary
