package patterns.pattern_command;
/*
The command pattern encapsulates a request as an object,
letting you parameterize other objects with different requests,
queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

- In practice sometimes "smart" command objects implement the requests itself rather than delegating it to a receiver.
